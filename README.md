ALIZA
=====

ALIZA is ELIZA's younger feistier sister. Where ELIZA was a Rogerian therapist, ALIZA is an Ericksonian therapist (eventually she'll be both).

Inspired by *Her* I want to build a persistent AI that I can communicate with by chat or by text that will help me stay organized, journal my thoughts, stay positive, and generally assist me in my life.

Usage
=====

You can simply 

    git clone https://github.com/zencephalon/ALIZA.git
    cd ALIZA
    bundler install

then in IRB

    load "aliza.rb"
    start

Note that she has basic persistent memory.
